# Norths Schematics
## Overview
North's Schematics Mod is a survival/creative mode mod that lets players save blocks and block rotation to JSON files using the [File Manager](https://mcreator.net/plugin/64638/file-creator) plugin for [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/https://mcreator.net/plugin/64638/file-creator). Once the file is saved the player can load the structure anywhere in the Minecraft map. In survival mode structures are removed after they are saved. In creative mode they structures are cloned but not removed. Works for both servers and single player as well as LAN. Opped players can control the capped structure size limit. It is possible to save and load structures that are larger than Vanilla Minecraft's structure block size limit.

## Example Structure File
```json
{
# The display name of the player that saved the file.
  "owner": "Dev",
# When the structure is placed this value is set to true.
# This is later used in script for survival mode player and tested to know if the structure has been placed or not.
  "placed": false,
# When the file is save so is the structure size from the fields
  "size_x": 20.0,
  "size_y": 15.0,
  "size_z": 20.0,
# Each block is saved with its rotation.
  "1_block": "{Name:\"minecraft:grass_block\",Properties:{snowy:\"false\"}}",
  "1_rotation": 2,
  "2_block": "{Name:\"minecraft:grass_block\",Properties:{snowy:\"false\"}}",
  "2_rotation": 2,
